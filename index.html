                    <h3>#1 - Ningaloo Reef</h3>
                        <img src="./images/ningalooReef1.jpg" alt="Snorkelling at Ningaloo Reef" title="Ningaloo Reef" id="ningaloo">
                        <p>The World Heritage listed Ningaloo Reef is internationally recognised as one of the planet’s last great ocean paradises. Located in Western Australia's Gascoyne region and fronting the gateway townships of Exmouth and Coral Bay, the 300 kilometre long Ningaloo Reef is the largest fringing coral reef in the world.</p>
                        <p>The Ningaloo Reef can be accessed just footsteps from the beach – something very few coral reefs offer. Enjoy the clearest turquoise water imaginable in the Ningaloo Reef Lagoon and pristine coral gardens at the do-it-yourself snorkelling sites of Exmouth's Cape Range National Park or Coral Bay where you will swim with hundreds of colourful tropical reef fish species.</p>
                        <p>From March to August the Ningaloo Reef plays host to the world's largest aggregation of the world's biggest fish; the majestic whale shark tours to swim with whale sharks are available out of both Exmouth and Coral Bay, as well as many other eco-adventure tours to view a huge variety of marine wildlife including sea turtles, humpback whales, orcas (killer whales) dugong, manta rays, reef sharks and much more!</p>

                        <img src="./images/whitsundays1.JPG" alt="Heart Reef in the Whitsundays" title="Whitsundays" id="whitsundays">
                        <p>Make the most of Queensland’s tropical weather with a visit to The Whitsundays, home to a group of 74 idyllic islands. Spend your time sailing the crystal-clear waters, discover extraordinary marine life, or wander your way through prominent landmarks, from the Great Barrier Reef to the pure sands of Whitehaven Beach.</p>  
                        <p>The mainland side of The Whitsunday Coast is just as enticing, boasting beaches and national parks galore, and the coastal enclave of Airlie Beach, where holidaymakers gather year-round and the lifestyle’s as dreamy as the natural surroundings.
